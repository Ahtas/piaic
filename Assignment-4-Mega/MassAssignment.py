#%% Q.23. You are writing a function that increments player score in a soccer game
# If no value is specified for points, then point must start with 1
# If no value is specified for bonus, then bonus should be True
# 01 def increment_score ( bonus , score , points ):

### Answer:

# To meet the first requirement line 01 must be change to
# def increment_score ( bonus , score , points = 1 ): (True)

# To meet the second requirement line 01 must be change to
# def increment_score ( bonus = True , score , points = 1 ): (False) Because after default parameters we can't write parameters without default values

# Once a parameter is defined with default value, any parameter to the right must also be defined with default values (True)



#%% Q.24. What will be output?

### Code:
def avg (x , y , z = 50 ):
    adding = x + y + z
    avg_value = adding / 3
    return avg_value
y = avg ( x = 5 , y = 9 , z = 20 )

print(y) # 11.333333333333334 will be printed

### Answer:

# 11.333333333333334 will be printed


#%% Q.25.  What will be output? Describe it with reason and logic behind.
# Do multiple experiments with arguments / parameters to remove error, if occurs.

### Code:
def avg ( *opt_values , name ):
    avg_value = sum (opt_values) / len(opt_values)
    print("name is: " + name + " Marks: " + str(avg_value))

avg ( 5 , 9 , 20, 34, 87, 112 , name="Ali" ) # 44.5  will be printed

### Answer:
# 44.5  will be printed
# There was an error for name parameters because we taking *opt_values as a first argument and if it is first argument we must have to pass
# all right side params as a named arguments. so it is fixed by using name="Ali" argument


#%% Q.26. Final output is not required. Just take copy pencil, think and write the output of each line,
# write down the link between parameters and arguments. Remove one or two ** from other_info and observe the ouput.

### Code:

def display_result(winner, score, **other_info):
    print("The winner was " + winner)
    print("The score was " + score)
display_result(winner="Manchester", score="4-3", overtime ="yes", injuries="none")

### Answer:

# Output :
#The winner was Manchester
#The score was 4-3

# winner and score are named argument and will map to function params as it is
# overime and injuries will map to other_info which is directory unpacking/decomposing parameter
# remove one * will give an error as it will expect comma seperated values but we are passing named arguments which doesn't exists
# remove two ** will also give an error as it will expect other_info param as a single required parameters while we aren't providing this param



#%% Q.27. The position of parameters and arguments is re-arranged. Just think and find the logic behind output or error.

### Code:
def display_result(winner, score, **other_info): # Rearranged params because unpacking dictionary can't be in middle
    print("The winner was " + winner)
    print("The score was " + score)

display_result(winner="Manchester", overtime ="yes", injuries="none" , score="1-0" )


### Answer:
# unpacking dictionary can't be in middle

### Answer:

# c) No output  but if print it then d) 1.234560, 1.234560, 01.23



#%% Q.31. Write down the output of each line after each iterations. Do multiple experiments to change values

### Code

i = 1
while False: # This code will never run because we set expression as false, if it set by true then it will run infinity time
    if i%2 == 0:  # if the value is even then break the loop
        break
    print(i)
    i += 2  # add 2 into i existing value

### Answer:

# As the code above it will never run due to False condition in while statement
# If we change
#     While True then it will run infinity time because break condition will never meet which is i should be even.
#     if we set i even number 2 then it will never print i value and break before reaching to print statement due to if condition
#     if we set i odd number then it will run infinity time


#%% Q.32. Write down the output of each line after each iterations. Do multiple experiments to change values

### Code

x = "abcdef"
i = "a"
while i in x:
    x = x[:-1] # reduce string length from end but never move cursor to next item
    print(i, end = " ")

### Answer:

# Iteration 1
# x = abcdef
# ouput a

# Iteration 2
# x = abcde
# ouput a

# Iteration 3
# x = abcd
# ouput a

# Iteration 4
# x = abc
# ouput a

# Iteration 5
# x = ab
# ouput a

# Iteration 6
# x = a
# ouput a

# Final Output:  a a a a a a

# List Empty and while conition is break


#%% Q.33. Write down the output of each line after each iterations. Do multiple experiments to change values

### Answer:
# list function will convert string into charater list
# reversed function will iterate in a reverse order on list
# join function will join the generated reverse order list into string
# and loop will iterate over string and print character one by one
# Also if we don't join the reverse list the output will be same

for i in ''.join(reversed(list('abcd'))):
    print (i)

# Iteration 1 - d
# Iteration 2 - c
# Iteration 3 - b
# Iteration 4 - a

#%% Q.34.

for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    else:
        print(i)
else:
    print("Here")

### Answer:

# Iteration 1 - Fall in else block - will print = 0
# Iteration 2 - Fall in else block - will print = 1
# Iteration 3 - Fall in else block - will print = 2
# Iteration 4 - Fall in else block - will print = 3
# Iteration 5 - Fall in else block - will print = 4
# Iteration 6 - Fall in if block value of i = 5 - Loop will be break
# It will only fall in else block if the ranger or given list is zero its called for-else loop


#%% Q.35.
y = 6
z = lambda x: x * y
print (z(8))

### Answer:

#lambda functions are inline functions are annoymous function
#In above code we have created a lambda function which takes parameter x value and multiply with a block scope variable y and return it
#Ouput of above code will be 48 where x=8 and y = 6


#%% Q.36.  Write output and give proper logic of whatever the output comes

i=0
def change(i):
    i=i+1
    return i
change(1)
print(i)

### Answer:

# When we print i after calling change function it will show the old i value which was set at the time of initialization not the one we have
# changed in then "change" function. because the i have different scope in both block, in change function we are getting single paramter "i"
# which have local scope and it can't change the outter side variable value. until variable is passed through ref or the returned value again
# assigned to i where function is calling such as i = change(1)

### Answer:

# Above code will output :
#   1- a type of variable "two"
#   2- a tuple value (2, 3, 4)
# As we used decomposing operater "*" in parameter which will convert all the comma seperated argument after required argument "one" into tuple


#%% Q.41. What will be output? Define this output clearly

### Code :

def find(a, **b):
    print(type(b))
find('letters',A='1',B='2')

### Answer:
# It will return dict type object,  **b will take all key value pair arguments after a and will generate a dictionary of these options


#%% Q.42.  Write output and define each lineâ€™s output for each iteration of â€˜iâ€™

def foo(i, x=[]):
    x.append(i)
    return x
for i in range(3):
    print(foo(i))

### Answer:

# For loop from 0 to 3
# Will pass i value into foo function

# Iteration 1 :
#   i = 0, x = empty array
#   appent i into x list
#   x will be [0]
#   Print value x which is return by function foo in loop

# Iteration 2 :
#   i = 1, x = [0]
#   append i into x list, which is already innitialized on first iteration
#   x will be [0, 1]
#   Print value x which is return by function foo in loop

# Iteration 3 :
#   i = 2, x = [0, 1]
#   append i into x list, which is already exists in memory
#   x will be  [0, 1, 2]
#   Print value x which is return by function foo in loop

# Here main point is to be noted x array is only initialized one time because its reference type and behave like static data in memory
